//An inline function is a function for which the compiler attempts to expand the functionâ€™s code in place where it is called, rather than using the typical function call mechanism (which involves overhead for function call, parameter passing, etc.).

//Working of inline function:
//The square() function is declared inline. Instead of making a function call, the compiler replaces the function call square(num) with its code num * num directly at the call site.

//When to Use Inline Functions:
//Inline functions are beneficial for small, frequently used functions.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Inline function definition
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    
    // Calling the inline function
    cout<<"Square of "<<num<<" is: "<<square(num)<<endl;

}
//Square of 5 is: 25
