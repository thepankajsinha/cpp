✅ Class
A class is a user-defined blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior (data + functions) of an object.

It defines:
Data members (variables)
Member functions (methods)
But it does not occupy memory until objects are created from it.




✅ Object
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated. But when an object is created, memory is allocated for its data members.

Each object:
Has its own copy of the data members.
Can call the class’s member functions.
